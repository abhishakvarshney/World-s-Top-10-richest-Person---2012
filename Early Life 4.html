Bernard Jean Étienne Arnault was born March 5, 1949, in Roubaix, France. His father Jean Leon Arnault was a manufacturer, owner of a civil engineering company, Ferret-Savinel. After graduating from the Maxence Van Der Meersch High School in Roubaix, Bernard Arnault was admitted to the École Polytechnique (X1969) from which he graduated with an engineering degree in 1971.<P>
Bernard Arnault has been married twice, and is the father of five children. As the director for LVMH, his daughter Delphine Arnault is actively involved in the management of the luxury group. His son Antoine Arnault is Head of Communications for Louis Vuitton. His second wife, Hélène Mercier, is a Canadian pianist from Quebec. The couple have three sons. His nephew Harry Seaman is also involved in LVMH, overseeing sales and he is currently researching in the U.K.<P>
Bernard Arnault was a witness at President Nicolas Sarkozy's wedding to Cécilia Ciganer-Albéniz. In January 2007 Kathryn Blair, the daughter of former British Prime Minister Tony Blair, completed an intensive French language and culture course at France's Sorbonne University. Tony Blair has been criticised for accepting an invitation on her behalf from Bernard Arnault. During Kathryn Blair's course, which ran from 12 October 2006 to 26 January 2007, she is thought to have been provided with an accommodation, security and transport package worth around £80,000.
