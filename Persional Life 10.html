Because Karl Albrecht has withdrawn himself from public life, little is known about him. Forbes magazine reports that he has two children, neither of whom is employed by Aldi. He reportedly lives in Essen, as did his brother Theo until the latter's death. He is a fan of golf, and plays at his personal golf course, the Öschberghof, which he built in 1976. He also raises orchids. It is rumored that he collects antique typewriters and has made a take-over bid for Leeds United.
